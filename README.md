# Software Engineering Blog

My personal blog. Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). 

[Live demo](https://softwareengineering.netlify.app/)

The project was built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is automatically deployed using a modern CI/CD Pipeline with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

To run locally, `yarn`, `yarn install`, `yarn start`, then open https://localhost:8000.
